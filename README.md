# learn-user-stories

- Because I have implemented the user stories before class, and then since there are new requirements raised in class (like constraint for age), I have to re-implement the user stories, that's why you can see the user stories being moved from 'completed' to 'open' and then to 'completed' again.
- The implementation of the types and the bank who manages the accounts are in src folder
- The tests are in tests folder
- To run the tests, go into the tests folder `cd tests`, then run `node bankTest.js`
